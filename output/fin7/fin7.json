Further, the use of code signing in at least one case highlights the group's judicious use of resources, potentially limiting their use of these certificates to cases where they have been attempting to bypass particular security controls. Barring any further law enforcement actions, we expect at least a portion of the actors who comprise the FIN7 criminal organization to continue conducting campaigns.",

These malicious files are embedded into the infection documents using the Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) framework within Windows, which allows objects from one application to be included in another.\n In the documents released today, FIN7 appears to have pivoted from using OLE embedded LNK files to using OLE embedded CMD files. When executed, the CMD file writes JScript to \u201ctt.txt\u201d under the current user\u2019s home directory. The batch script then copies itself to \u201cpp.txt\u201d, also under the current user\u2019s home directory, before running WScript using the JScript engine on the file. This JScript code will read from the file \u201cpp.txt\u201d, skipping the first four lines (the CMD code itself), but otherwise evaluating anything after the first character for each line in the file.\n Although different in implementation, this is a familiar technique, as FIN7 frequently runs commented out code that they read as a string through the use of JScript\u2019s \u201ceval\u201d function.\n",

This may suggest the actor\u2019s desire to obtain new phishing targets within a victim organization. If any of these new targets fell victim to the phishing lure, it would allow FIN7 to increase their foothold within a victim organization\u2019s network and potentially pivot to new areas.\n The command \u201cgetNK2\u201d is likely named after outlook\u2019s NK2 file, which contains a list of auto-complete addresses for Microsoft Outlook 2007 and 2010. Newer versions of outlook no longer use the NK2 file, so FIN7 has also written functionality to handle newer versions of Outlook within the same \u201cgetNK2\u201d command. The command will execute the JScript function in Figure 3 on the victim system.\n Detection authors must make trade-offs to optimize signature performance; narrow signatures lead to high fidelity detections, but risk missing changes in actor behaviors, meanwhile broader detection patterns provide better coverage, at the risk of more false positives. Combatting a well-resourced and adaptive adversary requires a layered approach of both signature styles.\n FIN7 has demonstrated that they are highly adaptable, evading detection mechanisms while impacting a number of large US retail companies over an extended period of time.",

Two separate C2 servers wereused during the observed periods: one used heavily during initial access and a second one used more during post-exploitation activities.\n The authoritative DNS servers for the malicious domains were geographically distributed, but all hosted within the same low-reputation Virtual Private Server (VPS) provider. The secondary C2 method leveraged a different encrypted communication channel. Infrastructure for the secondary C2 method was also hosted on the same geographically disparate low-reputation VPS provider.\n",

This time window is not intended to perform any sort of attribution but was useful when planning and coordinating phases of the response effort.\n Using these timelines, Gigamon ATR was able to identify FIN7 employing different C2 techniques based on their operational patterns. Before concluding operations for the day, the adversary would set their callback times to one hour, and change the mode of their communications to use A resource records (instead of TXT records). This change appeared to be an attempt by the actors to maintain a lower profile by using more natural queries in the environment. Further, the threat actors would spawn a secondary C2 component during their off-hour periods in an apparent attempt to maintain access should the DNS C2 be detected.",

The following characteristics may identify suspicious DNS behavior (note: multiple legitimate solutions use similar schemes to communicate.

When these components are removed from the scatter plot (leaving only JavaScript) we see similar clusters to the first generation of documents:\nFigure 4: Modified Plot of PowerShell DLL Documents\nBased on the number of clusters and range of entropy we see that this generation of documents contain more files with varying functionality and depth. This plotting technique also provides a method of identifying new functionality by showing outliers, such as the labeled PS Outlier which contains an array of encoded PowerShell bytes rather than a blob that provides the final PowerShell for DLL injection:\nFigure 5: Identified New PowerShell Functionality Due to Entropy Outlier\nFigure 6: Variables and Path GUID JS Changes\nThis functionality also highlights an interesting obfuscation mechanism that some emulation engines may ignore.",
