The full evasion achieved against the detection engines deployed to VirusTotal \u2013 as compared to an unsigned BOOSTWRITE sample with an invalid checksum\u2013 illustrates that FIN7\u2019s methods were effective in subverting both traditional detection and ML binary classification engines. This is a known issue and has been deeply studied since at least 2016\u2019s \u201cChains of Distrust\u201d research and 2017\u2019s \u201cCertified Malware\u201d paper. Since there are plenty of goodware samples with bad or no signatures \u2013 and a growing number of malware samples with good signatures \u2013 there is no easy solution here. The upside is that vendors selectively deploy engines to VirusTotal (including FireEye) and VT detection performance often isn\u2019t a comprehensive representation of encountering full security technology stacks that implement detection-in-depth. Later in this blog we further explore BOOSTWRITE\u2019s PE Authenticode signature, its anomalies, and how code signing can be turned from a detection challenge into detection opportunities.",

These malicious actors are members of one of the most prolific financial threat groups of this decade, having carefully crafted attacks targeted at more than 100 organizations. FIN7 is referred to by many vendors as \u201cCarbanak Group,\u201d although we do not equate all usage of the CARBANAK backdoor with FIN7. This blog explores the range of FIN7's criminal ventures, the technical innovation and social engineering ingenuity that powered their success, a glimpse into their recent campaigns, their apparent use of a security company as a front for criminal operations, and what their success means for the threat landscape moving forward. With this release, FireEye is also providing technical context, historical indicators, and techniques that organizations can use to hunt for FIN7 behavior enterprise-wide.",
