When executed, the CMD file writes JScript to \u201ctt.txt\u201d under the current user\u2019s home directory. The batch script then copies itself to \u201cpp.txt\u201d, also under the current user\u2019s home directory, before running WScript using the JScript engine on the file. This JScript code will read from the file \u201cpp.txt\u201d, skipping the first four lines (the CMD code itself), but otherwise evaluating anything after the first character for each line in the file.\n Although different in implementation, this is a familiar technique, as FIN7 frequently runs commented out code that they read as a string through the use of JScript\u2019s \u201ceval\u201d function.\n",

Newer versions of outlook no longer use the NK2 file, so FIN7 has also written functionality to handle newer versions of Outlook within the same \u201cgetNK2\u201d command. The command will execute the JScript function in Figure 3 on the victim system.\n Detection authors must make trade-offs to optimize signature performance; narrow signatures lead to high fidelity detections, but risk missing changes in actor behaviors, meanwhile broader detection patterns provide better coverage, at the risk of more false positives. Combatting a well-resourced and adaptive adversary requires a layered approach of both signature styles.\n FIN7 has demonstrated that they are highly adaptable, evading detection mechanisms while impacting a number of large US retail companies over an extended period of time.",

This change appeared to be an attempt by the actors to maintain a lower profile by using more natural queries in the environment. Further, the threat actors would spawn a secondary C2 component during their off-hour periods in an apparent attempt to maintain access should the DNS C2 be detected.",
