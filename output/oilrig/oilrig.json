This activity continued through 2019 with the HardPass operation, in which the LinkedIn platform was used in the same manner.\n In this latest campaign from January, a document submitted to VirusTotal from Lebanon (a common target for APT34), also depicts such a job opportunity document, although in this case we were unable to confirm the initial delivery mechanism to the target.\n In the following article we analyze the latest infection chain used by the attackers and deep dive into the new malware variant.\n",
