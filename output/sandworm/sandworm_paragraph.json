Dragos \nwould like to thank ESET for sharing the digital hashes which allowed the Dragos \nteam to spawn its investigation. Without control of the timeline, it was Dragos\u2019 \ndesire to publish a report alongside ESET\u2019s report to capture the nuance of elec-\ntric grid operations. The report also contains new discoveries, indicators, and im-\nplications of the tradecraft. Also, because of the connectio n to the activity group \nDragos tracks as ELECTRUM, it was our decision that an independent report was \nwarranted. The Dragos team has been busy over the last 96 hours reproducing and \nverifying ESET\u2019s analysis, hunting for new samples of the malware and potential ad-\nditional infections, notifying appropriate companies, and informing our customers. \nImportantly, Dragos also updated ICS vendors that needed to be made aware of \nthis capability, relevant government agencies, many national computer emergen-\ncy response teams (CERTs), and key players in the electric energy community. Our \nmany thanks to those involved.\n",
