Also, because of the connectio n to the activity group \nDragos tracks as ELECTRUM, it was our decision that an independent report was \nwarranted. The Dragos team has been busy over the last 96 hours reproducing and \nverifying ESET\u2019s analysis, hunting for new samples of the malware and potential ad-\nditional infections, notifying appropriate companies, and informing our customers. \nImportantly, Dragos also updated ICS vendors that needed to be made aware of \nthis capability, relevant government agencies, many national computer emergen-\ncy response teams (CERTs), and key players in the electric energy community.

It was the \ufb01rst known in-\nstance where a cyber-attack had disrupted electric grid operations. The Sandworm \nteam was attributed to the attack and their use of the BLACKENERGY 3 malware. \nBLACKENERGY 3 does not contain ICS components in the way that BLACKENER-\nGY 2 did. Instead, the adversaries leveraged the BLACKENERGY 3 malware to gain \naccess to the corporate networks of the power companies and then pivot into the \nSCADA networks. While in the environment the adversaries performed their recon-\nnaissance and eventually leveraged the grids systems against itself. They learned \nthe operations and used the legitimate functionality  of distribution management \nsystems to disconnect substations from the grid leaving 225,000+ customers \nwithout power for upwards of 6 hours until manual operations could restore pow-\ner. However, due to the wiping of Windows systems through the KillDisk malware \nand destruction of serial-to-Ethernet devices through malicious \ufb01rmware updates, \nthe Ukrainian grid operators were without their SCADA environment, meaning they \nlost the ability for automated control, for upwards of a year in some locations. The \nmost notable aspect of the attack was the adversary\u2019s focus on learning how to \nleverage the systems against themselves. Malware enabled the attack, and malware \n",

And it took the same type \nof approach to understanding grid operations and leveraging the systems against \nthemselves displayed in Ukraine 2015\u2019s attack. It did all of these things with added \nsophistication in each category giving the adversaries a platform to conduct at-\ntacks against grid operations systems in various environments and not con\ufb01ned to \nwork only on speci\ufb01c vendor platforms. It marks an advancement in capability by \nadversaries who intend to disrupt operations and poses a challenge for defenders \nwho look to patching systems as a primary defense, using anti-malware tools to \nspot speci\ufb01c samples, and relying upon a strong perimeter or air-gapped network \nas a silver-bullet solution.
