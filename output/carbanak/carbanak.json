Dmytro Fedorov, 44, Fedir Hladyr, 33, and Andrii Kopakov, 30, are suspected to be key members within CARBON SPIDER\u2019s point of sale (POS) subgroup.\n The arrests took place between January and June 2018, and coincided with a slowdown in CARBON SPIDER activity. The DoJ announcement also details the group\u2019s use of a front company, named Combi Security, to recruit developers and intrusion specialists for its operations. Given that other members of this subgroup remain at large, it is likely that the tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) may change but activity will continue.\n",

The RC2 key used for the HTTP protocol has also been observed to change among samples with the same compile time. These observations paired with the use of campaign codes that must be configured denote the likely existence of a build tool.\n Despite the likelihood of a build tool, we have found 57 unique compile times in our sample set, with some of the compile times being quite close in proximity.

Kaspersky released a similar report about the same group under the name \"Carbanak\" in February 2015. The name \u201cCarbanak\u201d was coined by Kaspersky in this report \u2013 the malware authors refer to the backdoor as Anunak.\n This activity was further linked to the 2014 exploitation of ATMs in Ukraine. Additionally, some of this early activity shares a similarity with current FIN7 operations \u2013 the use of Power Admin PAExec for lateral movement.\n The details that can be extracted from CARBANAK provide us with a unique insight into the operational details behind this data-stealing malware.
