While the first command in Figure 2 above, vssadmin Delete Shadows /all /quiet, is commonly used by ransomware, the command option vssadmin resize shadowstorage is rarely used. In situations where shadow copies were not created by vssadmin, but by third-party applications (such as backup software), vssadmin can display an error and not delete the backups. One such error states: \u201cSnapshots were found, but they were outside of your allowed context. Try removing them with the backup application which created them.\u201d The vssadmin resize shadowstorage command is a \u201chack\u201d that relies on vssadmin to delete storage when the shadow copies are resized. It forces the shadow copies to be deleted regardless of their context. The command works by resizing the default shadow volume size from 10 percent to 401 MB (the minimum size is 300 MB). Then the shadow storage is set to unbounded, which allows it to use all available disk space.
