The campaign seemed to be related to the MenuPass (a.k.a. APT10/Stone Panda/Red Apollo) threat actor, and utilized an open-source backdoor named QuasarRAT to achieve persistence within an organization. We identified several distinct loader variants tailored to specific targets by leveraging machine learning (ML) to analyse our malware corpus. We have not observed new QuasarRAT samples in the wild since late 2018, roughly coinciding with when the FBI indicted several members of the MenuPass group.",

Both malware families demonstrate a level of sophistication in their conception and development while the extensible code base of FlowCloud malware suggests that this group may have been operating as early as 2016. TA410 operators demonstrate a willingness to dynamically evolve phishing tactics to increase the effectiveness of their campaigns and a keen eye towards plausible social engineering within a very select targeted sector. It remains unclear if the nature of the tactics and indicators that are shared with TA429 (APT10) were developed by this group or culled from readily available technical reporting that pre-dated these campaigns. The possibility remains that these overlaps represent intentional false flag efforts to cloak the identity of these perpetrators while they targeted a critical and geo-politically sensitive sector of energy providers in the US. Regardless of the actor\u2019s intention, TA410 has established itself as a motivated actor with mature toolsets carrying out long term campaigns against highly important and geographically concentrated target sets.",

Essentially, this involves creating a remediation plan for effectively combating the threat and using round-the-clock intrusion detection and threat analysis to prevent attacks from entering the system. A proactive strategy can be much more effective for targeted attacks, as these kinds of attacks are often designed to be elusive and difficult to detect, thus the need to scope them out. A comprehensive security strategy that involves proactive incident response will need the input of both decision makers and tech-savvy personnel, as they will need to be on the same page for it to be effective.",
