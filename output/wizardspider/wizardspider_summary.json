For example, many ransomware families contain extensive lists of file extensions or folder names that should not be encrypted (whitelisted), but Ryuk only whitelists three extensions: It will not encrypt files with the extensions exe, dll, or hrmlog. The last extension appears to be a debug log filename created by the original Hermes developer. It should be noted that absent from this list is sys (system drivers), ocx (OLE control extension) and other executable file types. Encrypting these files could make the host unstable.
