While incidents continue to come to light, there is a lot the cybersecurity industry doesn\u2019t know: the volume of attacks, average cost of remediation and organizations who choose to stay silent once an attack has occurred.\n What is known is that the criminal groups behind ransomware are flourishing, creating new variants and offering access on underground markets to anyone that has access to corporate networks and a desire to make a substantial amount of illicit money. Intel 471 has been tracking over 25 different ransomware-as-a-service crews over the past year, ranging from well-known groups that have become synonymous with ransomware, to newly-formed variants that have risen from the failures of old, to completely new variants that may have the ability to unseat the current top-level cabals.\n The following is an examination of Ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) crews that have grown over the past year. This is not meant to be a definitive measure of the ransomware scene, as what could be considered \u201cdamaging\u201d \u2014 payment amount, system downtime, communications with attackers \u2014 could vary by crew or incident.",
