In this blog, we reveal two of FIN7\u2019s new tools that we have called BOOSTWRITE and RDFSNIFFER.The first of FIN7's new tools is BOOSTWRITE \u2013 an in-memory-only dropper that decrypts embedded payloads using an encryption key retrieved from a remote server at runtime. FIN7 has been observed making small changes to this malware family using multiple methods to avoid traditional antivirus detection, including a BOOSTWRITE sample where the dropper was signed by a valid Certificate Authority.",

Once loaded, `DWrite.dll` connects to a hard-coded IP and port from which it retrieves a decryption key and initialization vector (IV) to decrypt two embedded payload DLLs. To accomplish this task, the malware first generates a random file name to be used as a text log under the current user's %TEMP% directory; this filename starts with ~rdf and is followed by a set of random numbers. Next, the malware scans its own image to find the location of a 32-byte long multi-XOR key which is used to decode data inside its body. Part of the decoded data is an IP address and port which are used to retrieve the key and the IV for the decryption of the embedded payloads. The encryption algorithm uses the ChaCha stream cipher with a 256-bit key and 64-bit IV.Once the key and the IV are downloaded the malware decrypts the embedded payloads and performs sanity checks on the results.",

These malicious files are embedded into the infection documents using the Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) framework within Windows, which allows objects from one application to be included in another.\n In the documents released today, FIN7 appears to have pivoted from using OLE embedded LNK files to using OLE embedded CMD files. When executed, the CMD file writes JScript to \u201ctt.txt\u201d under the current user\u2019s home directory. The batch script then copies itself to \u201cpp.txt\u201d, also under the current user\u2019s home directory, before running WScript using the JScript engine on the file. This JScript code will read from the file \u201cpp.txt\u201d, skipping the first four lines (the CMD code itself), but otherwise evaluating anything after the first character for each line in the file.\n Although different in implementation, this is a familiar technique, as FIN7 frequently runs commented out code that they read as a string through the use of JScript\u2019s \u201ceval\u201d function.\n",

Throughout the various environments, FIN7 leveraged the CARBANAK backdoor, which this group has used in previous operations. A unique aspect of the incidents was how the group installed the CARBANAK backdoor for persistent access. Mandiant identified that the group leveraged an application shim database to achieve persistence on systems in multiple environments.",

Mandiant identified that FIN7 also used this technique to install a payment card harvesting utility for persistent access. This was a departure from FIN7\u2019s previous approach of installing a malicious Windows service for process injection and persistent access. Application Compatibility Shims BackgroundAccording to Microsoft, an application compatibility shim is a small library that transparently intercepts an API (via hooking), changes the parameters passed, handles the operation itself, or redirects the operation elsewhere, such as additional code stored on a system.\u00a0 Today, shims are mainly used for compatibility purposes for legacy applications.",

The main goal behind its malicious activities was to steal financial assets from companies, such as debit cards, or get access to financial data or computers of finance department employees in order to conduct wire transfers to offshore accounts.\n In 2018-2019, researchers of Kaspersky Lab\u2019s Global Research and Analysis Team analyzed various campaigns that used the same Tactics Tools and Procedures (TTPs) as the historic FIN7, leading the researchers to believe that this threat actor had remained active despite the 2018 arrests. In addition, during the investigation, we discovered certain similarities to other attacker groups that seemed to share or copy the FIN7 TTPs in their own operations.\n Recent FIN7 campaigns\nThe FIN7 intrusion set continued its tailored spear phishing campaigns throughout last year.",

Defenders will see more attacks on their businesses by hacker groups utilizing memory for evasion while keeping executable artifacts far away from disk.\n In this continuously evolving threat landscape, enterprises need to look for new defenses that are resilient to such changes and are able to prevent fileless attacks. Morphisec Endpoint Threat Prevention specializes in preventing in-memory attacks, using Moving Target Defense to make the target itself unpredictable.\n\u00a0\n",
