This actor provides compelling examples of these new approaches, using LinkedIn scraping, multi-vector and multistep contacts with recipients, personalized lures, and varied attack techniques to distribute the More_eggs downloader, which in turn can distribute the malware of their choice based on system profiles transmitted to the threat actor. In response to the increasing effectiveness of layered defenses and end user education efforts, we can expect more threat actors to adopt approaches that improve the effectiveness of their lures and increase the likelihood of high-quality infections.\n ",

The attackers have the advantage of choosing where to execute their malicious code and when to execute it, while runtime detection solutions cannot constantly scan the memory to detect the attack precisely when it manifests without significantly impacting the performance of the process runtime.\n It is important to note that Morphisec prevents these types of attacks immediately, without any prior knowledge of the attack form or techniques.",

Incident response teams may\nhave visibility into the technical aspects of the breach itself, while\ncyber crime researchers monitor the movement and sale of stolen\ndata in the criminal underground.\n FireEye Threat Intelligence and iSIGHT Partners recently combined\nour research to illuminate the activities of one particular threat group:\nFIN6. This combined insight has provided unique and extensive\nvisibility into FIN6\u2019s operations, from initial intrusion to the methods\nused to navigate the victims\u2019 networks to the sale of the stolen\npayment card data in an underground marketplace. In this report,\nwe describe FIN6\u2019s activities and tactics, techniques and procedures\n(TTPs), and provide a glimpse into the criminal ecosystem that\nsupports the \u201cpayoff\u201d for their operations.\n",

The gang\u2019s relationship with the boutique underground provider selling the TerraLoader loader and More_eggs backdoor leads to direct evidence of its use of PowerTrick and Anchor.\n Bringing this cybercrime seller back into the picture, SentinelOne researchers reported observing a threat actor using PowerTrick and Anchor to download two samples developed and sold by the same seller: a TerraLoader that installs the More_eggs backdoor and a TerraLoader that deploys a signed Metasploit shellcode loader. The evidence provided below links these two samples to ITG08.\nMore_eggs Sample Analysis\nX-Force IRIS is almost certain the TerraLoader and More_eggs samples were purchased by ITG08 based on similarities with two other More_eggs samples. We encountered the first sample in 2019 during an investigation of attacks we attributed to ITG08. We found the second sample, a Terraloader dropping a More_eggs backdoor, in a public repository that also showed ties to the ITG08 group.\n\n\n\n\n",

The group has\ncompromised multiple point-of-sale (POS) environments using the TRINITY POS (aka FrameworkPOS)\nmalware. In September 2017, forensic investigations of several undisclosed entities revealed evidence that\nFIN6 actors changed to target card-not-present (CNP) data when they could not deploy their malware in\nthe POS environment. Evidence shows that FIN6 injected malicious code into the merchants\u2019 eCommerce\nenvironment, placing skimming malware on the victims\u2019 checkout pages. Based on Visa Payment Fraud\nDisruption\u2019s (PFD) analysis of eCommerce compromises throughout 2018, FIN6\u2019s focus on the CNP\nenvironment has only amplified, suggesting that the cybercrime group has fully incorporated\ntargeting CNP environments into their criminal methodology.\n The majority of eCommerce compromises reported in 2018 involved direct targeting of vulnerabilities\nwithin the eCommerce website itself. As one of the more sophisticated groups targeting eCommerce\nmerchants, FIN6 brings their POS compromise approach to the emerging threat landscape of CNP\nbreaches. FIN6 targets companies, using phishing emails in an attempt to infect the targeted victim\u2019s\nnetwork.",

ImplicationsBased on our belief that the MAZE ransomware is distributed by multiple actors, we anticipate that the TTPs used throughout incidents associated with this ransomware will continue to vary somewhat, particularly in terms of the initial intrusion vector.",
