In this blog, we reveal two of FIN7\u2019s new tools that we have called BOOSTWRITE and RDFSNIFFER.The first of FIN7's new tools is BOOSTWRITE \u2013 an in-memory-only dropper that decrypts embedded payloads using an encryption key retrieved from a remote server at runtime.

Once loaded, `DWrite.dll` connects to a hard-coded IP and port from which it retrieves a decryption key and initialization vector (IV) to decrypt two embedded payload DLLs. To accomplish this task, the malware first generates a random file name to be used as a text log under the current user's %TEMP% directory; this filename starts with ~rdf and is followed by a set of random numbers. Next, the malware scans its own image to find the location of a 32-byte long multi-XOR key which is used to decode data inside its body. Part of the decoded data is an IP address and port which are used to retrieve the key and the IV for the decryption of the embedded payloads. The encryption algorithm uses the ChaCha stream cipher with a 256-bit key and 64-bit IV.Once the key and the IV are downloaded the malware decrypts the embedded payloads and performs sanity checks on the results.",

These malicious files are embedded into the infection documents using the Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) framework within Windows, which allows objects from one application to be included in another.\n In the documents released today, FIN7 appears to have pivoted from using OLE embedded LNK files to using OLE embedded CMD files. When executed, the CMD file writes JScript to \u201ctt.txt\u201d under the current user\u2019s home directory. The batch script then copies itself to \u201cpp.txt\u201d, also under the current user\u2019s home directory, before running WScript using the JScript engine on the file. This JScript code will read from the file \u201cpp.txt\u201d, skipping the first four lines (the CMD code itself), but otherwise evaluating anything after the first character for each line in the file.\n Although different in implementation, this is a familiar technique, as FIN7 frequently runs commented out code that they read as a string through the use of JScript\u2019s \u201ceval\u201d function.\n",

Throughout the various environments, FIN7 leveraged the CARBANAK backdoor, which this group has used in previous operations. A unique aspect of the incidents was how the group installed the CARBANAK backdoor for persistent access. Mandiant identified that the group leveraged an application shim database to achieve persistence on systems in multiple environments.",
