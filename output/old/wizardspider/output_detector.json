Falcon Intelligence has been monitoring the geo-based download activity from Emotet and, during 2018, MUMMY SPIDER has been an avid supporter of WIZARD SPIDER, predominantly distributing TrickBot to Emotet victims in the U.K., the U.S., and Canada.\n  Some of TrickBot\u2019s modules (such as pwgrab) could aid in recovering the credentials needed to compromise environments \u2014 the SOCKS module in particular has been observed tunneling PowerShell Empire traffic to perform reconnaissance and lateral movement.

Intel 471 has been tracking over 25 different ransomware-as-a-service crews over the past year, ranging from well-known groups that have become synonymous with ransomware, to newly-formed variants that have risen from the failures of old, to completely new variants that may have the ability to unseat the current top-level cabals.\n The following is an examination of Ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) crews that have grown over the past year.
