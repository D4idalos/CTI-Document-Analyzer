During the last month, this malware family has been referenced in several security blogs and government alerts.\n Carbon Black is publicly providing this technical write up to assist customers, other organizations, and researchers continuing to investigate incidents related to this malware family. Along with this report, Carbon Black is providing product specific queries, rules and scripts aimed at assisting in the detection and analysis of this malware family in the Carbon Black User Exchange. The overall process of how the malware\u2019s components are created on an infected system and the different points where the suite of Carbon Black products could detect the different stages of the malware are outlined in that User Exchange post.\n",
