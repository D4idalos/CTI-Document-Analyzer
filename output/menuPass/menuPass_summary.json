WHOIS records and passive DNS information for ffca.caibi379[.]com indicate that the registrant email and address fields for the domain were updated on June 7, 2019. The A record for the domain was updated on September 9, 2019 at which time it resolved to the IP 34.80.27[.]200 contained within an ASN owned by Google. For the prior eight months beginning on January 2, 2019 and encompassing the period of activity discussed by enSilo, the domain was hosted on several IP\u2019s in an ASN owned by APNIC Hostmaster. The shift away from IP infrastructure owned by APNIC represents a departure in threat actor infrastructure hosting tactics well after the publication by enSilo and within the weaponization period for TA410\u2019s campaign targeting US utilities. While this research is not conclusive, it demonstrates that all observed TA429 (APT10) similarities and indicators of compromise were available publicly prior to the start of TA410 campaigns. Therefore, while not conclusive from current analysis, the possibility remains that these overlaps represent false flag activity by the TA410 threat actor. Based on this analysis Proofpoint analysts track TA410 as a distinct threat actor from TA429 (APT10) at this time.",

TA410 operators demonstrate a willingness to dynamically evolve phishing tactics to increase the effectiveness of their campaigns and a keen eye towards plausible social engineering within a very select targeted sector. It remains unclear if the nature of the tactics and indicators that are shared with TA429 (APT10) were developed by this group or culled from readily available technical reporting that pre-dated these campaigns.
