We identified several distinct loader variants tailored to specific targets by leveraging machine learning (ML) to analyse our malware corpus. We have not observed new QuasarRAT samples in the wild since late 2018, roughly coinciding with when the FBI indicted several members of the MenuPass group.",

WHOIS records and passive DNS information for ffca.caibi379[.]com indicate that the registrant email and address fields for the domain were updated on June 7, 2019. The A record for the domain was updated on September 9, 2019 at which time it resolved to the IP 34.80.27[.]200 contained within an ASN owned by Google. For the prior eight months beginning on January 2, 2019 and encompassing the period of activity discussed by enSilo, the domain was hosted on several IP\u2019s in an ASN owned by APNIC Hostmaster. The shift away from IP infrastructure owned by APNIC represents a departure in threat actor infrastructure hosting tactics well after the publication by enSilo and within the weaponization period for TA410\u2019s campaign targeting US utilities. While this research is not conclusive, it demonstrates that all observed TA429 (APT10) similarities and indicators of compromise were available publicly prior to the start of TA410 campaigns. Therefore, while not conclusive from current analysis, the possibility remains that these overlaps represent false flag activity by the TA410 threat actor.
