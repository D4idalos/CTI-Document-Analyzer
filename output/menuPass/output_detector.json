Also, the certificate embedded in the Quasar sample was issued at 22.12.2018, which correlates with the file\u2019s compilation date.

        "text": "Malware payloads and operational infrastructure can be quickly changed or replaced over time, and as such, the task of tracking a threat actor can become quite difficult.\n For that reason, it is crucial to profile the threat actor and study its behavior, the tools it uses, and its techniques. These behavioral-based TTPs are less likely to change drastically, and are\\ key factors of any threat hunt or attribution efforts.\n The Cybereason solution is compatible with the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which made it easy to keep track of the observed TTPs and correlate the data with known threat actors.\n The following chart reflects the behavioral profile of the threat actor based on the most frequently observed techniques used throughout these attacks.\n In order to make sense of all the data, we fed it into multiple threat intelligence sources, including our own and third parties.\n \u26a0\ufe0f Note: Since we cannot share any IOCs, we will refer to file hashes, hostnames, IP addresses and other IOCs as generic placeholders.\n",
