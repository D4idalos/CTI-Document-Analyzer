Also, the certificate embedded in the Quasar sample was issued at 22.12.2018, which correlates with the file\u2019s compilation date. This may indicate that these samples are a part of a testing environment or a short-lived attack that is already finished.

The blog claims that this URL delivered a modified Quasar RAT payload which included the addition of SharpSploit, an opensource post-exploitation tool. When analyzed on the same date of FlowCloud campaign delivery this URL and resource was unavailable, while the DropBox URL successfully delivered the FlowCloud .pem file. While Proofpoint has not independently verified these attribution claims made by other researchers regarding the referenced Quasar RAT sample, the use of this URL represents a previously undisclosed overlap with publicly reported indicators of compromise attributed to TA429 (APT10). While on the surface this domain may imply links to TA429 (APT10), we have identified several aberrations regarding the domain registration information and inactive nature of the URL and will discuss them at length at length later in this blog.\n",

PlugX has in the past been documented as being delivered via a self extracting (SFX) Rar executable, which acts as the first stage dropper.\n Once the files have been created on disk, the dropper will execute the Obedience.exe file, starting the overall process. A brief overview of the entire process is outlined in the below two figures and the accompanying table.\n The first stage dropper will push several hard-coded values to a function, which is responsible for decoding the three embedded files.

Further, they are not impervious to psychological warfare, as in, trying to \u201cpin\u201d an operation on a different threat actor to avoid proper attribution.\n In order to increase the certainty level when attributing to a specific threat actor, we took the following aspects of the attacks into consideration: \nCarefully examining each of the different aspects plays an important role in avoiding misattribution. This model offers a more balanced interpretation of the data that is based on a myriad of components. By performing a contextualized review of the data, you are able to yield a more wholesome result with greater certainty.\n When it comes to attributing Operation Soft Cell, we are unable to achieve 100% certainty with regard to the identity of the threat actor. However, based on our interpretation of the data, we conclude with a high level of certainty that:\nThe threat actor behind Operation Soft Cell is likely state-sponsored.\n The threat actor is affiliated with China.\n",
