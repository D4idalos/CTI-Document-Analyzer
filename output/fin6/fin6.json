The command consisted of a byte array containing a base64 encoded payload shown in Figure 1.\n The encoded payload was a Cobalt Strike httpsstager that was injected into the PowerShell process that ran the command. The Cobalt Strike httpsstager was configured to download a second payload from hxxps://176.126.85[.]207:443/7sJh. FireEye retrieved this resource and determined it was a shellcode payload configured to download a third payload from hxxps://176.126.85[.]207/ca. FireEye was unable to determine the final payload due to it no longer being hosted at the time of analysis.\n",

However, we believe it important to publish even a partial analysis so that enterprises are aware of, and immediately block, any access to the URLs listed below.\n As stated in the introduction, the infiltration vector is yet to be determined, although after retro-hunting on VT and matching it to our known telemetry events, we believe that at least one vector is executed through HTA files that execute PowerShell scripts as part of an embedded VBScript.\n Additional hunting reveals additional scripts that lead to the same Cobalt Strike beacon. It is not known if the scripts below are part of a lateral movement or just additional examples of infiltration samples. However, at least some of them are executed through WMI which may indicate an intermediate stage. \n",

Based on Visa Payment Fraud \nDisruption\u2019s (PFD) analysis of eCommerce compromises throughout 2018, FIN6\u2019s focus on the CNP \nenvironment has only amplified, suggesting that the cybercrime group has fully incorporated \ntargeting CNP environments into their criminal methodology.  \n The majority of eCommerce compromises reported in 2018 involved direct targeting of vulnerabilities \nwithin the eCommerce website itself.

Even within these teams, the cyber criminals appear to be task-oriented meaning that one operator is not responsible for the full lifecycle.
