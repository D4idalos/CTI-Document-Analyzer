During a recent incident response investigation, our team identified new attacks by the financially motivated attack group ITG08, also known as FIN6.\n ITG08 is an organized cybercrime gang that has been active since 2015, mostly targeting point-of-sale (POS) machines in brick-and-mortar retailers and companies in the hospitality sector in the U.S. and Europe. More recently, the group has been observed targeting e-commerce environments by injecting malicious code into online checkout pages of compromised websites \u2014 a technique known as online skimming \u2014 thereby stealing payment card data transmitted to the vendor by unsuspecting customers.\n Based on our investigation and analysis of its adversarial tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs), we believe ITG08 is actively attacking multinational organizations, targeting specific employees with spear phishing emails advertising fake job advertisements and repeatedly deploying the More_eggs JScript backdoor malware (aka Terra Loader, SpicyOmelette). This tool, a TTP observed in ITG08 attacks since 2018, is sold on the dark web by an underground malware-as-a-service (MaaS) provider.",

While malicious actors could monetize stolen data in various way (e.g. sale in an underground forum, fraud), actors employing MAZE are known to threaten the release of stolen data if victim organizations do not pay an extortion fee.\n In addition to data theft, actors deploy MAZE ransomware to encrypt files identified on the victim network. Notably, the aforementioned MAZE panel has an option to specify the date on which ransom demands will double, likely to create a sense of urgency to their demands.\n Based on our belief that the MAZE ransomware is distributed by multiple actors, we anticipate that the TTPs used throughout incidents associated with this ransomware will continue to vary somewhat, particularly in terms of the initial intrusion vector.",
